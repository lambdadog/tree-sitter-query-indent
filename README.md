# Tree-Sitter Query-Based Indentation for Emacs

WIP

Built as a richer alternative to
[tree-sitter-indent](https://github.com/emacsmirror/tree-sitter-indent)
for
[rescript-tree-sitter-mode](https://github.com/lambdadog/rescript-tree-sitter-mode). It
can be used for any mode, however, much like `tree-sitter-hl`.
